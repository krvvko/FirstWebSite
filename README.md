# FirstWebSite
Here is my attempt to make my first very own Website for ECS courses using HTML and CSS.


Since this is my first website, the code may not be perfect, and it is more demo than educational, 
but still I will be very happy if this simple code helps someone to learn about new, or repeat old 
features of HTML and CSS.



File "index.html" - the main page of my site, from this page you can get to others, and back. 
The rest of the files are additional pages with various information and content. The "styles.css" 
file is responsible for the site design.










All content not created by me was taken solely for educational purposes from open sources. Almost 
all the images were not created by me, and were taken from various resources.
